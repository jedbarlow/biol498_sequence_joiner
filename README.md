Delimited Sequence Joiner
=========================

This project is a plugin for [CLC Genomics
Workbench](http://www.clcbio.com/products/clc-genomics-workbench/) that joins
DNA sequences, optionally inserting a custom delimiter sequence between them.

For example, given a list of sequences,

  - AAAAAAA
  - GGGGGGG
  - CCCCCCC

and entering a delimiter,

  - NNNN

the plugin produces the following output.

  - AAAAAAANNNNGGGGGGGNNNNCCCCCCCNNNN

The compiled plugin package can be downloaded [here](http://www.ualberta.ca/~ejbarlow/biol498/).
